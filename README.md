# SI -CARI
SI-CARI is a fake news detection website built using Streamlit.

The website is deployed into Heroku.

SI-CARI uses deep learning to detect fake news.

The deep learning model is trained using this dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset

The dataset is divided into 80% training data and 20% test data.

The LSTM model using word embedding GloVe gained 99.09% accuracy, 99.19% precision, 99.07% recall, 99.13 % F-1 Score.
